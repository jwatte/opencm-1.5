opencm-1.5
=====

An attempt to use the Arduino-1.5 IDE with the Robotis OpenCM-900/904 core.

Just copy the 'hardware' folder into sketchbook you use for Arduino-1.5 and restart the IDE.  Everything should 'just work'.


Warning
-----
This repository is likely going to change a lot as attempts are made to replace the Maple derived 'robotis' core with a new one more closely resembling that of the Due.  I will be attempting to keep the 'robotis' core up to date with the core released by Robotis for the OpenCM repository, but no promises.

Description
-----
Basically, it is the last core from the ROBOTIS\_CM9\_Series repository with the minimum modifications required to get it working correctly with the Arduino-1.5 IDE. Will be working in the future on a new branch to replace the Maple derived core with one more closely resembling that of the Due.  It will likely take quite some time to do.

Features
-----
- Works with Arduino-1.5 for both compiling sketches and uploading binaries.
- Python script to successfully upload code to all CM-9 boards released thus far.
